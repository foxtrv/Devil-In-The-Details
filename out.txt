Canto 12 Descending by a very rugged way into the seventh
circle, where the violent are punished, Dante and his leader
find it guarded by the minotaur; whose fury being pacified
by Virgil, they step downward from crag to crag; till, drawing
page 546 / 554
near the bottom, they descry a river of blood, wherein are
tormented such as have committed violence against their
neighbor.Canto 29 Dante, at the desire of Virgil, proceeds onward to the
bridge that crosses the tenth gulf, from whence he hears the
cries of the alchemists and forgers, who are tormented therein;
but not being able to discern anything on account of the
darkness, they descend the rock, that bounds this the last of
page 552 / 554
the compartments in which the eighth circle is divided, and
then behold the spirits who are afflicted by divers plagues and
diseases.Canto 18 The Poet describes the situation and form of the eighth
circle, divided into ten gulfs, which contain as many different
descriptions of fraudulent sinners; but in the present Canto he
treats only of two sorts; but in the present Canto he treats
only of two sorts: the first is of those who, either for their own
pleasure or for that of another, have seduced any woman from
her duty; and these are scourged of demons in the first gulf;
the other sort is of flatterers, who in the second gulf are condemned
to remain immersed in filth.Canto 11 Dante arrives at the verge of a rocky precipice which
incloses the seventh circle, where he sees the sepulcher of
Anastasius the Heretic; behind the lid of which, pausing a little,
to make himself capable by degrees of enduring the fetid smell
that steamed upward from the abyss, he is instructed by Virgil
concerning the manner in which the three following circles are
disposed, and what description of sinners is punished in each.Canto 17 The monster Geryon is described; to whom while
Virgil is speaking in order that he may carry them both
down to the next circle, Dante, by permission, goes a
little further along the edge of the void, to descry the third
species of sinners contained in this compartment, namely,
those who have done violence to Art; and then returning to
his master they both descend, seated on the back of Geryon.Canto 22 Virgil and Dante proceed, accompanied by the
page 550 / 554
Demons, to see other sinners of the same description in the
same gulf.Canto 31 The poets, following the sound of a loud horn, are led
by it to the ninth circle, in which there are four rounds, one incised
within the other, and containing as many sorts of Traitors; but
the present Canto shows only that the circle is encompassed
with Giants, one of whom Antaeus, takes them both in his arms
and places them at the bottom of the circle.Canto 16 Journeying along the pier, which crosses the sand, they
are now so near the end of it as to hear the noise of the stream
falling to the eighth circle, when they meet the spirits of three
military men; who judging Dante, from his dress, to be a
page 548 / 554
countryman of theirs, entreat him to stop.page 543 / 554
Canto 4 The Poet, being roused by a clap of thunder and
following his guide, onward, descends into Limbo, which is the
first circle of Hell, where he finds the souls of those, who
although they have lived virtuously and have not to suffer for
great sins, nevertheless, through lack of baptism, merit not
the bliss of Paradise.The two Poets then reach the place where
the water descends, being the termination of this third
compartment in the seventh circle; and here Virgil having
thrown down into the hollow a cord, wherewith Dante was girt,
they behold at that signal a monstrous and horrible figure
come swimming up to them.At these, when they strive to emerge from the brook,
a troop of Centaurs, running along the side of the river, aim their
arrows; and three of their band opposing our travelers at the
foot of their band opposing our travelers at the foot of the steep,
Virgil prevails so far, that one consents to carry them both
across the stream; and on their passage Dante is informed by
him of the course of the river, and of those that are punished therein.He next discourses of the third round, called Ptolomea, wherein
those are punished who have betrayed others under the semblance of
kindness; and among these he finds the Friar Alberigo de' Manfredi,
who tells him of one whose soul was already tormented in that
place, though his body appeared still to be alive upon the earth, being
yielded up to the governance of a fiend.page 545 / 554
Canto 10 Dante having obtained permission from his guide, holds
discourse with Farinata degli Uberti and Cavalcante Cavalcanti,
who lie in their fiery tombs that are yet open, and not to be closed
up till after the last judgement.Canto 13 Still in the seventh circle, Dante enters its second
compartment, which contains both those who have done
violence on their own persons and those who have violently
consumed their goods; the first changed into rough and knotted
trees whereon the harpies build their nests, the latter chased
and turn by black female mastiffs.Canto 24 Under the escort of his faithful master, Dante not
without difficulty makes his way out of the sixth gulf; and
in the seventh, see the robbers tormented by venomous and
pestilent serpents.page 544 / 554
Canto 7 In the present Canto, Date described his descent into
the fourth circle, at the beginning of which he sees Plutus
stationed.These are
plunged in a lake of boiling pitch, and guarded by Demons,
to whom Virgil, leaving Dante apart, presents himself;
and license being obtained to pass onward, both pursue their way.Canto 9 After some hindrances, and having seen the hellish
furies and other monsters, the Poet, by the help of an angle,
enters the city of Dis, wherein he discovers that heretics are
punished in tombs burning with intense fire; and he, together with
Virgil, passes onward between the sepulchers and walls of the city.Our Poet then meets with the spirits of three of his countrymen,
page 551 / 554
two of who undergo a marvelous transformation in his presence.It is a plain of dry and hot sand, where three kinds of
violence are punished: namely, against God, against Nature,
page 547 / 554
and against Art; and those who have thus sinned are tormented
by flakes of fire, which are eternally showering down upon
them.Dante is taken down by his guide
into the bottom of the gulf; and there finds Pope Nicholas the
fifth, whose evil deeds, together with those of the other pontiffs,
are bitterly reprehended.page 553 / 554
Canto 33 The Poet is told by Count Ugolino de' Cherardeschi of
the cruel manner in which he and his children were famished
in the tower at Pisa, by command of the Archbishop Ruggieri.Canto 26 Remounting by the steps, down which they had
descended to the seventh gulf, they go forward to the arch
that stretches over the eighth, and from thence behold
numberless flames wherein are punished evil counsellors,
each flame containing a sinner, save one, in which were
Diomede and Ulysses, the latter relates the manner of his death.Canto 3 Dante, following Virgil, comes to the gate of Hell;
where, after having read the dreadful words that are written
thereon, they both enter.Canto 6 On his recovery, the Poet finds himself in the third
circle, where the gluttonous are punished.And in the midst is Lucifer, at whose back Dante and Virgil ascend,
till by a secret path they reach the surface of the other hemisphere
of the earth, and once more obtain sight of the stars.Canto 5 Coming tot he seconds circle of Hell, Dante at the
entrance beholds Minos the Infernal Judge, by whom he is
admonished to beware how he enters those regions.Dante proposes
a question to his guide, who solves it; and they proceed toward
the fourth circle.page 538 / 554

The Emporor Henry of Luxemburgh, bu whom he had hoped
to be restored to Florence, dies.Dante dies at Ravenna, of a complaint brought on by
disappointment at his failure in a negotiation which
he had been conducting witht he "Venetians, for his
patron Guido Novella da Polenta.From
hence Virgil takes occasion to show how vail the goods that
are committed into the charge of Fortune; and this moves our
author to inquire what being that Fortune is, of whom he speaks;
hich question being resolved, they go down into the fifth circle,
where they find the wrathful and gloomy tormented in the
Stygian Lake.Canto 23 The enraged Demons pursue Dante, but he is preserved
from them by Virgil.1315

page 554 / 554Then pursuing their way, they arrive at the
river Acheron; and there find the old ferryman Charon, who
takes the spirits over to the opposite shore; which as soon as
Dante reaches, he is seized with terror, and falls into a trance.Hence he is led on by Virgil to descend
into the second circle.Canto 8 A signal having been made from the tower, Phlegyas,
the ferryman of the lake, speedily crosses it, and conveys
Virgil and Dante to the other side.
