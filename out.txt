Therefore I think and judge it for thy best
Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,
And lead thee hence through the eternal place,
Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,
Who cry out each one for the second death;
And thou shalt see those who contented are
Within the fire, because they hope to come,
Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;
To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,
A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;
With her at my departure I will leave thee;
Because that Emperor, who reigns above,
In that I was rebellious to his law,
Wills that through me none come into his city.And I to him: " Poet, I thee entreat,
page 12 / 554
By that same God whom thou didst never know,
So that I may escape this woe and worse,
Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
And those thou makest so disconsolable.""Thee it behoves to take another road,"
Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
page 10 / 554
Because this beast, at which thou criest out,
Suffers not any one to pass her way,
But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;
And has a nature so malign and ruthless,
That never doth she glut her greedy will,
And after food is hungrier than before.And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,
Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead-
But when he saw that I did not withdraw,
page 25 / 554
He said:"By other ways, by other ports
Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for,passage;
A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.""O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry
Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,
Leaving the practice of so great an office,
"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;
Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;
And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,
Said, to encourage me:"Let not thy fear
Harm thee; for any power that he may have
Shall not prevent thy going down this crag "
Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,
And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;
Consume within thyself with thine own rage.page 18 / 554
"Beatrice" said she, " the true praise of God,
Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,
For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?page 15 / 554
That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,
I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard
At the first moment when I grieved for thee.Now go, for one sole will is in us both,
Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be
page 40 / 554
Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them
By love which leadeth them, and they will come."Thou art my master, and my author thou,
Thou art alone the one from whom I took
The beautiful style that has done honour to me.page 46 / 554
And I to him:"The anguish which thou hast
Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,
So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.A poet was I, and I sang that just
Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,
After that Ilion the superb was burned
page 9 / 554
But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?And I to him:"With weeping and with wailing,
Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;
For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.""Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain
For this once," said my Lord; " thou shalt not have
Longer than in the passing of the slough."page 24 / 554
People I saw on a great river's bank;
Whence said I: " Master, now vouchsafe to me,
That I may know who these are, and what law
Makes them appear so ready to pass over,
As I discern athwart the dusky light."page 30 / 554
"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"
Began I, with desire of being certain
Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,
"Came any one by his own merit hence,
Or by another s, who was blessed thereafter?"This way there never passes a good soul;
And hence if Charon doth complain of thee
page 27 / 554
Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."I answered him:"Ciacco, thy wretchedness
Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;
But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come
The citizens of the divided city;
page 47 / 554
If any there be just; and the occasion
Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."So thoroughly has Longfellow done the work of elucidating his
version of the text of Dante, that there is absolutely nothing
page 3 / 554
left for other commentators to do.--Every biblical and every
classical allusion is annotated and referenced, every side light
that can possibly be needed is thrown upon the work all through;
and his "footlights of the great comedy" as he himself called his
notes and illustrations are illuminating it for all time.Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,
Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,
That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;
Love has conducted us unto one death;
Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!""Master," I said to him, " now tell me also
What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,
That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"Cord never shot an arrow from itself
That sped away athwart the air so swift,
As I beheld a very little boat
page 58 / 554
Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,
Under the guidance of a single pilot,
Who shouted,"Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"In her entreaty she besought Lucia,
And said, " Thy faithful one now stands in need
Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."And he to me:"Ere unto thee the shore
Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;
Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask
What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?Then paused she, and thereafter I began:
'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom
The human race exceedeth all contained
Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,
So grateful unto me is thy commandment,
To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;
No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.Thus we went circling round the filthy fen
A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,
With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;
page 57 / 554
Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.Said the good Master:"Son, thou now beholdest
The souls of those whom anger overcame;
And likewise I would nave thee know for certain
Beneath the water people are who sigh
And make this water bubble at the surface,
As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.When they together had discoursed somewhat,
They turned to me with signs of salutation,
And on beholding this, my Master smiled;
And more of honour still, much more, they did me,
page 33 / 554
In that they made me one of their own ban
So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.page 59 / 554
And I to him:"Although I come, I stay not;
But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"After she thus had spoken unto me,
Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;
Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;
And unto thee I came, as she desired;
I have delivered thee from that wild beast,
Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,
Who nearer him before the others stand;
Democritus, who puts the world on chance,
Diogenes, Anaxagoros, and Thales,
Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;
page 35 / 554
Of qualities I saw the good collector,
Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,
Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,
Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,
Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,
Averroes, who the great Comment made." The first of those, of whom intelligence
Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,
"The empress was of many languages.O living creature gracious and benignant,
Who visiting goest through the purple air
Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,
If were the King of the Universe our friend,
We would pray unto him to give thee peace,
Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,
That they sinned not; and if they merit had,
'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism
Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;
And if they were before Christianity,
In the right manner they adored not God;
And among such as these am I myself
For such defects, and not for other guilt,
Lost are we and are only so far punished,
That without hope we live on in desire.""O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"
He said to me. "Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about
Through his half-circle to another joust;
And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,
page 52 / 554
Exclaimed:"My Master, now declare to me
What people these are, and if all were clerks,
These shaven crowns upon the left of us."page 43 / 554
When as we read of the much-longed-for smile
Being by such a noble lover kissed,
This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,
Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.David Reed
Editorial Note
page 1 / 554
A lady who knew Italy and the Italian people well, some thirty
years ago, once remarked to the writer that Longfellow must have
lived in every city in that county for almost all the educated
Italians "talk as if they owned him."page 42 / 554
Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,
And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,
Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.page 17 / 554
'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,
Briefly will I relate,'she answered me,
'Why I am not afraid to enter here.Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,
Seeing that three such Ladies benedight
Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,
And so much good my speech doth promise thee ?"While we were running through the dead canal,
Uprose in front of me one full of mire,
And said, " Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"He whose omniscience everything transcends
page 54 / 554
The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,
That every part to every part may shine,
Distributing the light in equal measure;
He in like manner to the mundane splendours
Ordained a general ministress and guide,
That she might change at times the empty treasures
From race to race, from one blood to another,
Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.And as he is who willingly acquires
And the time comes that causes him to lose,
Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
page 8 / 554
E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,
Which, coming on against me by degrees
Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent
While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
Before mine eyes did one present himself,
Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,
First one and then another, till the branch
Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;
In similar wise the evil seed of Adam
Throw themselves from that margin one by one,
At signals, as a bird unto its lure.Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,
To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,
page 14 / 554
Which of salvation's way is the beginning.page 53 / 554
Forever shall they come to these two buttings;
These from the sepulchre shall rise again
With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.But when thou art again in the sweet world,
I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;
No more I tell thee and no more I answer."He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;
'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;
Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,
On whose account the maid Camilla died,
Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;
Through every city shall he hunt her down,
Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,
There from whence envy first did let her loose.page 16 / 554
Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,
And with what needful is for his release,
Assist him so, that I may be consoled."O thou who honourest every art and science,
Who may these be, which such great honour have,
That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
For the pernicious sin of gluttony
I as thou seest, am hattered bv this rain
And I, sad soul, am not the only one,
For all these suffer the like penalty
For the like sin, " and word no more spake he."Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered."Let us descend now into the blind world,"
Began the Poet, pallid utterly;
"I will be first, and thou shalt second be."And unto him my Guide: " Why criest thou too?But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun
The here descending down into this centre,
From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'page 23 / 554
And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,
Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,
That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;
And after it there came so long a train
Of people, that I ne'er would have believed
That ever Death so many had undone.And he:"They are among the blacker souls;
A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;
If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,
page 13 / 554
Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient.We to the place have come, where I have told thee
Thou shalt behold the people dolorous
Who have foregone the good of intellect."The time was the beginning of the morning,
And up the sun was mounting with those stars
page 7 / 554
That with him were, what time the Love Divine
At first in motion set those beauteous things;
So were to me occasion of good hope,
The variegaled skin of that wild beast,
The hour of time, and the delicious season;
But not so much, that did not give me fear
A lion's aspect which appeared to me.page 32 / 554
After the voice had ceased and quiet was,
Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;
Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.Then was the fear a little quieted
page 6 / 554
That in my heart's lake had endured throughout
The night, which I had passed so piteously
And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
Which never yet a living person left.page 20 / 554
Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,
I entered on the deep and savage way.Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,
That will we hear, and we will speak to you,
page 41 / 554
While silent is the wind, as it is now.And the Guide said to me:"He wakes no more
This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;
When shall approach the hostile Potentate,
Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,
Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,
Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce
Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,
For which the human race each other buffet;
For all the gold that is beneath the moon,
Or ever has been, of these weary souls
Could never make a single one repose."page 29 / 554
And this arose from sorrow without torment,
Which the crowds had, that many were and great
Of infants and of women and of men.The basis of the work with its copious, information and
illuminating notes, expositions and illustrations was his courses
page 2 / 554
of Lecutre on Dante given in many places during many years; in
these Lecture it was his early custom to read in translation, the
whole or parts of the poem chosen for his subject, with his
notes, expositions and illustrations interspersed.__With what
infinite pains and conscientious care the work was done, and how
thoroughly he was penetrated with the thought and expression of
the poet, his Diaries, his Life and his Letters abundantlyu show,
and the work as it stands is a Masterpiece of scholarly and
sympathetic rendering, interpretation and exposition.And he to me, as one experienced:
"Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,
page 21 / 554
All cowardice must needs be here extinct.Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,
Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,
page 48 / 554
And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,
Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;
For great desire constraineth me to learn
If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."page 60 / 554
And I:"My Master, much should I be pleased,
If I could see him soused into this broth,
Before we issue forth out of the lake."towards us coming in a boat
An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,
Crying: " Woe unto you, ye souls depraved
Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;
I come to lead you to the other shore,
To the eternal shades in heat and frost.And I, who of his colour was aware,
Said:"How shall I come, if thou art afraid,
Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"page 38 / 554
And as the wings of starlings bear them on
In the cold season in large band and full,
So doth that blast the spirits maledict;
It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;
No hope doth comfort them for evermore,
Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.I saw Electra with companions many,
'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aenas,
Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;
I saw Camilla and Penthesilea
On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,
Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;
I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,
Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,
And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.INFERNO

MIDWAY upon the journey of our life
I found myself within a forest dark,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.And he to me: "These things shall all be known
To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay
Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."True is it, that upon the verge I found me
Of the abysmal valley dolorous,
page 28 / 554
That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.There opposite, upon the green enamel,
Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,
page 34 / 554
Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.But, if to recognise the earliest root
Of love in us thou hast so great desire,
I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.And he to me:"Vain thought thou entertainest;
The undiscerning life which made them sordid
Now mal~es them unto all discernment dim.Hence he drew forth the shade of the First
And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,
Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient
Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,
Israel with his father and his children,
And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,
And others many, and he made them blessed;
And thou must know, that earlier than these
Never were any human spirits saved."And I:"Its mosques already, Master, clearly
page 61 / 554
Within there in the valley I discern
Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire
They were.Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;
And she began to say, gentle and low,
With voice angelical, in her own language
'O spirit courteous of Mantua,
Of whom the fame still in the world endures,
And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;
A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,
Upon the desert slope is so impeded
Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,
And may, I fear, already be so lost,
That I too late have risen to his succour,
From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless
Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,
Who at the last hour combated with Love
Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand
Shades did he name and point out with his finger,
Whom Love had separated from our life."Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain
Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"And he to me:"The fire eternal
That kindles them within makes them look red,
As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."page 19 / 554
Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,
While yet corruptible, unto the world
Immortal went, and was there bodily.Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those
People, whom the black air so castigates?"Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,
page 26 / 554
Beckoning to them, collects them all together,
Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,
Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,
Uplift themselves all open on their stems;
Such I became with my exhausted strength,
And such good courage to my heart there coursed,
That I began, like an intrepid person:
"O she compassionate, who succoured me,
And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon
The words of truth which she addressed to thee!"If I have well thy language understood,"
Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,
"Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,
Which many times a man encumbers so,
It turns him back from honoured enterprise,
As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.Not without making first a circuit wide,
We came unto a place where loud the pilot
Cried out to us, " Debark, here is the entrance."Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,
On one side and the other, with great howls,
Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.When I beheld him in the desert vast,
"Have pity on me," unto him I cried,
"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;
He kissed my face, and said: " Disdainful soul,
Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.So, as I enter her from day to day,
And leave my burden at this minster gate,
Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,
The tumult of the time disconsolate
page 4 / 554
To inarticulate murmurs dies away,
While the eternal ages watch and wait.page 22 / 554
And he to me:"This miserable mode
Maintain the melancholy souls of those
Who lived withouten infamy or praise.page 31 / 554
We ceased not to advance because he spake,
But still were passing onward through the forest
The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.page 36 / 554
There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;
Examines the transgressions at the entrance;
Judges, and sends according as he girds him.page 37 / 554
Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;
It is so willed there where is power to oo
That which is willed; and ask no further question."page 39 / 554
She is Semiramis of whom we read
That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;
She held the land which now the Sultan rules.page 44 / 554
In the third circle am I of the rain
Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;
Its law and quality are never new.page 45 / 554
And my Conductor, with his spans extended,
Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,
He threw it into those rapacious gullets.page 49 / 554

Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,
Touching a little on the future life.CANTO 7

But with the head and with the breast and feet,

DAY was departing, and the embrowned air
Released the animals that are on earth
From their fatigues; and I the only one
Made myself ready to sustain the war,
Both of the way and likewise of the woe,
Which memory shall retrace, that erreth not.Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,
Things did he hear, which the occasion were
Both of his victory and the papal mantle.Naturally enough, ever since Longfellow's first visit to Europe
(1826-1829), and no doubt from an eariler date still, he had been
interested in Dante's great work, but though the period of the
incubation of his translation was a long one, the actual time
engaged in it, was as he himself informs us, exactly two years.Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;
Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,
Saying, " Away there with the other dogs!"And he to me:"The anguish of the people
Who are below here in my face depicts
That pity which for terror thou hast taken."O, of the other poets honour and light,
Avail me the long study and great love
That have impelled me to explore thy volume!recall me, if thou canst;
Thyself wast made before I was unmade."
